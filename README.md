# PiBox Case

These are the files for 3D printing your own PiBox case.

The STL files are the ones you'll want to download, and the STEP files can be used if you want to make modifications in your own CAD program.

## ðŸŽ‰ Print without supports!

These case files are designed to be printed without supports. All overhangs have angles that extend gradually, so there should be no need for supports when printing. For each clamshell, should position the face on the build plate, as shown below.
